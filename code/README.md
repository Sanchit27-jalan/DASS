### **Web Dashboard for Image Preprocessing**

Welcome to the Web Dashboard for Image Preprocessing. This document will help you navigate through the platform, ensuring you can efficiently use all available features for managing, annotating, and exporting 360-degree images.
<p id="assumptions_and_preconditions"></p>

## <span style="color:skyblue"><a id="2" ></a>Assumptions & Preconditions</span>
- To use our application, users are required to have an account. If you're new to the platform, simply navigate to the sign-up page to get started.
- Upon logging in, users gain access to their projects and associated annotations. Login is essential for accessing and managing project-related information effectively.
- Our frame-cutting algorithm neatly organizes all image frames into designated files as frameNumber.jpg, stored in the folder named by the convention "username_projectNumber_imageNumber" in the directory ./project_360/django_project/media/CROP, facilitating easy retrieval and management.
- Annotations can be added to images only after labels have been incorporated into the project.  
- The annotations using segmentation tool are done by simply holding down the "Shift" key while hovering your cursor over the area you wish to segment. No need to clickâ€”just seamlessly glide over the desired section.
